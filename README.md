<p>Since 2008, 34 states have cut spending for K-12 education
                drastically, causing hundreds of thousands to feel inadquelty
                prepared for their exams and search for outside academic
                enrichment through tutoring services. However, private tutoring
                can cost up to $450, preventing low-income students from having
                access to the same academic advantages as their rich
                counterparts. With Educatx, we aim to solve this problem by
                uniquely connecting high school students with upperclassmen
                tutors who have pursued similar coursework. Students are asked
                to fill out a form about their academic struggles and current
                coursework. Our application analyzes their data and connects
                them with tutors for free. Tutors recieve community service
                hours for helping their peers suceed academically.

<p>As a student in public school, I was inspired to create this app after personally witnessing how my friends in regular classes frequently dropped out of honors and ap classes, due to the lack of academic support.  In comparison to many individuals on the honors and ap track, my friends could not afford $80 private tutoring sessions, SAT Prep, and struggled to find free resources online which helped them learn curriculum taught in advanced classes.   As a student who is fortunate enough to have access to a private tutor, I’ve personally seen how many of my grades increase by 10% after 4 private tutoring sessions.  This external academic enrichment should be accessible to students no matter what their income level, as all students should have access to the same educational opportunities to succeed academically.   Through Educatx, I wanted to bridge the gap between students and tutors from all over the world and allow students to not also succeed academically, but feel confident in rigorous courses.</p>

<p> While registering, students are asked whether they would like to register as a student or a tutor.  If a user choses student, they are asked to fill out a form about their academic struggles, current coursework, and what they need from their tutor. If a user choses tutor, they are asked to fill out a form about their academic successes, teaching methods, and past tutoring experiences.  Our dynamic application then analyzes the student’s/tutor’s data and shows them a list of tutors/students who would be the best fit for them. The information presented features answers from the student’s/tutor’s application in order for the user to know which individual they should choose to work with.  Tutors who have more references are displayed first in order to connect students with more experienced tutors.  In addition to connecting students and tutors, Educatx allows students and tutors to post blog posts, such as How To Improve Your SAT Score and How To Get A 5 On The AP Computer Science Exam.  This feature allows students and tutors to learn more about their coursework and provides them with access to academic resources, like study guides, in one central location. Our final feature allows students to schedule times to tutor through a calendar which is integrated in Educatx.   This allows students and tutors  to keep track and reschedule of the days they will be tutored.  The calendar feature also allows the Educatx platform to determine the amount of community service hours tutors should be given.</p>
