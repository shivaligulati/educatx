<p>Since 2008, 34 states have cut spending for K-12 education
                drastically, causing hundreds of thousands to feel inadquelty
                prepared for their exams and search for outside academic
                enrichment through tutoring services. However, private tutoring
                can cost up to $450, preventing low-income students from having
                access to the same academic advantages as their rich
                counterparts. With Educatx, we aim to solve this problem by
                uniquely connecting high school students with upperclassmen
                tutors who have pursued similar coursework. Students are asked
                to fill out a form about their academic struggles and current
                coursework. Our application analyzes their data and connects
                them with tutors for free. Tutors recieve community service
                hours for helping their peers suceed academically.
